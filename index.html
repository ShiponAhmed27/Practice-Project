                    <p>Bowling is a target sport and recreational activity in which a player rolls a ball toward pins
                        (in pin bowling) or another target (in target bowling). The term bowling usually refers to pin
                        bowling (most commonly ten-pin bowling), though in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth
                        countries, bowling could also refer to target bowling, such as lawn bowls.In pin bowling, the
                        goal is to knock over pins on a long playing surface known as a lane. Lanes have a wood or
                        synthetic surface onto which protective lubricating oil is applied in different specified oil
                        patterns that affect ball motion.</p>

                    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
                        Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
                        recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require
                        medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular
                        disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious
                        illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.The best
                        way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the
                        virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from
                        others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub
                        frequently. Get vaccinated when itâ€™s your turn and follow local guidance.</p>
